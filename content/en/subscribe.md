All unabridged contents of my website are also available as so-called [Web feeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed) and can be subscribed via a [feed reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator) of your choice on workstations and mobile devices.


## Language
The contents are basically divided according to the language. Some contents are available in both languages, others are only available for the respective language.
Depending on your interest, it may be useful to subscribe to both languages in order to actually see all available content in the feed reader.


## Feed addresses

Two different file formats are available: I recommend to use the modern [Atom feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) format, but also offer a [RSS feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) for better compatibility with older software.

- <a href="/feed.atom" rel="related" type="application/atom+xml">Atom (English)</a>
- <a href="/de/feed.atom" rel="related" type="application/atom+xml">Atom (German)</a>
- <a href="/feed.rss" rel="related" type="application/rss+xml">RSS (English)</a>
- <a href="/de/feed.rss" rel="related" type="application/rss+xml">RSS (German)</a>

You can also subscribe to a single category or a single keyword. However, it is not possible to combine several categories or keywords, each of which must be subscribed to individually.

### Subscribing to a single category

The categories of a post are displayed under the title. Click on it to see more articles in this category. The same address can be entered in a feed reader to subscribe to this category individually.

[List of all categories](/categories/)

### Subscribing to a single keyword

Keywords are displayed at the end of a post. Click on it to see more articles with this keyword. The same address can be entered in a feed reader to subscribe to this keyword individually.
