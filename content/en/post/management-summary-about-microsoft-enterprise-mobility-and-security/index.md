One or the other way, some people might have noticed it already: I launched my new personal website a couple of days ago.

Even though I transferred content from my old Tumblr blog here, this new beginning is certainly not just to modernize the look.

Earlier this year there was already some feeling that I wanted to producing more content for the community to document areas from my professional and personal activities in tech and consultancy work I do. Just recently I got some motivation to get back to that "feeling" and bring it to reality.

So what people can expect are a variety of topic categories being part of rather short and even longer posts on an irregular basis, but with the intention to release something now every few weeks. A plan about how to organize and categorize topics is in the process to manifest in my mind so let's see were this ends.

I will certainly document a few aspects and thoughts I considered to setup this website and blog. If you notice anything special and you want to read more about it here, leave a comment and it might be part of one of the next stories.

So, what do you think - any thoughts about the status quo?
